Manialive Plugins, ManiaPlanet, Twitter, Rounds

=========

Initial release 07-02-2013(RoundReport):

- Initial release of RoundReport based on plugin.rounds.php from xaseco2.

Made it a bit better with a  GUI of SM-ish like tot tell Scores in Team
mode for now.

Will report a round if players finish, Will also report if nobody
finished.

There might be some bugs as it was tested with one player.

=========

Initial Release 08-02-2013(Twitter):

- Initial release of Twitter plugin.

This will send a Tweet onReady(). It will put out a message after restarting manialive that the Tweet is a duplicate. No hard feelings for it though.

To set it up:

Sign in to the http://twitter.com and register an application from the http://dev.twitter.com/apps page.
!!!Remember to never reveal your consumer secrets.!!!
Click on My Access Token link from the sidebar and retrieve your own access token.
Now you have consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret.

Set the consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret in the Config.php of Twitter plugin.

Save the file and start it up.
